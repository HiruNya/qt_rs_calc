# Qt Rs Calc
A simple calculator built with Rust and Qt.

This is meant to be a simple example of using the [rust-qt-binding-generator](https://phabricator.kde.org/source/rust-qt-binding-generator) to create a qt application with rust.

``qmake``, qt libraries, and ``cargo`` need to be installed to build this.
